#### Java deep learning

**_Hi all,_**

 > Welcome to Java Learning!!

    * We have used many inbuilt features of java but we never understand how it works internally.
    Here we will go deep of most features of java and we will try to understand working with sample code.
    
 **1. Java Class Loading :-**
 Please go through this link for better understanding 
 of *JVM* **(Java Virtual Machine)** startup and class loading in *JVM*.

 ReadMe link :- [Java Class Loading](https://github.com/rakeshkumargupt/java-learning/blob/master/src/com/java/basic/classloading/JavaClassLoading.md)  
 Sample Code :- [TestClassLoading](https://github.com/rakeshkumargupt/java-learning/blob/master/src/com/java/basic/classloading/ClassLoadingTest.java)
 
 
 **2. Comparable in Java :-**
 Here we will implement comparable *_compare()_* method 
 for natural sorting on fields of classes.
 
 Sample code :- [Comparable in Java](https://github.com/rakeshkumargupt/java-learning/blob/master/src/com/java/basic/comparable/EmpManagement.java)
 
 
 **3. Comparator in Java :-**
 In this topic, we will implement new comparator 
 which will implement *_compareTo()_* method for sorting
 on two objects fields as we required.
